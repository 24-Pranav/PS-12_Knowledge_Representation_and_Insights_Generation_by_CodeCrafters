# Knowledge Representation and Insights Generation from Structured Dataset

This project focuses on developing an AI-based solution for knowledge representation and insight generation from structured datasets. It encompasses several key functionalities:

1. Data Pre-processing: Cleaning and preparing datasets by handling missing values, normalizing data, and encoding categorical variables.

2. Knowledge Representation: Using visual tools to create intuitive and informative visualizations, such as histograms, box plots, scatter plots, and heatmaps.

3. Pattern Identification: Applying machine learning algorithms like PCA, KMeans, and DBSCAN to detect patterns, trends, and anomalies within the dataset.

4. Insight Generation: Utilizing natural language generation models to convert analysis results into human-readable insights and recommendations.

5. User-friendly Interface: Providing an interactive web-based interface using Flask, allowing users to upload datasets, view visualizations, and receive generated insights.

## Installation (To Run the Project):

1. Clone the repository
    
2. Set Up a Virtual Environment
   It is recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies. You can set up a virtual environment using venv:

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```
3. Install Required Packages
   Install the necessary Python packages using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   Ensure requirements.txt includes all dependencies such as Flask, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, and Transformers.

4. Install Additional Dependencies
   Make sure you have all the required libraries for running the project.

5. For start the application please run the following command

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
6. Open your web browser and navigate to http://127.0.0.1:5000/ to start using the application.
